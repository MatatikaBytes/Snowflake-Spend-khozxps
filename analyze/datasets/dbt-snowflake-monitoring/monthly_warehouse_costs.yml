title: Monthly Snowflake warehouse costs (All time)
questions: What is the total Snowflake each month by warehouse?
description: |-
  Monthly Snowflake costs by warehouse.

  ## Monthly Spend per Warehouse
  This query uses the `daily_spend` model to explore spend by warehouse name. Some queries don't require a running warehouse, which 
  is why you'll see a row for `warehouse_name` = 'Cloud Services Only'.
